## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### âœ… Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- SQLite JDBC driver (ensure itâ€™s in your classpath)

### ðŸ—ƒ Database Setup

Ensure your SQLite database includes these tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Patients (
    Username TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    Salt BLOB NOT NULL,
    Hash BLOB NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Caregivers (
    Username TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    Salt BLOB NOT NULL,
    Hash BLOB NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Availabilities (
    Time DATE,
    Username TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (Time, Username),
    FOREIGN KEY (Username) REFERENCES Caregivers(Username)
);

CREATE TABLE Vaccines (
    Name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    Doses INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Reservations (
    AppointmentID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    VaccineName TEXT NOT NULL,
    Time DATE NOT NULL,
    CaregiverUsername TEXT NOT NULL,
    PatientUsername TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (VaccineName) REFERENCES Vaccines(Name),
    FOREIGN KEY (CaregiverUsername) REFERENCES Caregivers(Username),
    FOREIGN KEY (PatientUsername) REFERENCES Patients(Username)
);
